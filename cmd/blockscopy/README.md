# Blocks copy

This program can copy Cortex blocks between two GCS buckets. It is GCS specific and uses special calls to copy
files between buckets directly, without download to a local system first.

Blocks copy can run in one-time mode, or as a service and do regular copies.

It can be configured with minimum block time range to avoid copying of blocks that are too small.
It can also be configured with list of users to copy, or avoid copying blocks for.
